                    <p>In its efforts to combat terrorism, the German government has emphasized the need for the
                        protection of civil rights and liberties for both its citizens and non-citizens. However, some
                        policies nonetheless targeted Muslims living in Germany and were
                        criticized as racist and discriminatory.

                        <div class="inner">
                            <p>The southern German state of Baden-Württemberg implemented a rule requiring applicants
                                applying for German citizenship from certain Muslim-majority countries be sujected to
                                tougher questioning, effective January 2006. The policy only applied to
                                applicants from 57 Muslim-majority countries, and included questions on religious
                                freedom, gender equality, homosexuality, freedom of expression, the concept of honor,
                                and forced marriage. This policy has been widely criticized as discriminatory and
                                racist. While the intention of the policy was to test the loyalty of applicants applying
                                for German citizenship, it is hard to justify why only Muslims are subjected to enhanced
                                questioning while it is not necessary for others to do so. The policy inherently
                                discriminated against Muslims because it perceived them as potentially disloyal to
                                Germany and therefore should be subjected to additional questioning. In addition, the
                                contents of the new questions also drew debate on whether they really test loyalty to
                                Germany or are just meant to instill fear in Muslim applicants. For instance, a portion
                                of the German public do not support LGBTQ rights so it is unfair to question citizenship
                                applicants about their views on this issue.
                            </p>
                            <p>In April 2017, German lawmakers approved a partial ban on burqas, prohibiting public
                                servants - including election officials, military, and judicial staff - from wearing the
                                burqa when working. Far-right politicians in Germany even called for a total ban on
                                burqas, though this effort did not succeed. The policy was implemented in the aftermath
                                of several terrorist attacks in Germany, including one where a truck killed 12 people at
                                a Berlin Christmas market. It was also implemented ahead of the German federal elections
                                in September 2017. This policy has been criticized for discriminating
                                against Muslim women in Germany. While the policy was aimed at combating terrorism, it
                                targeted Muslim women who wear the burqa and their religious rights were infringed.
                            </p>
                            <p>Lastly, German police has been accused of racial profiling and race-based surveillance
                                practices. German police were criticised for internally using the term Nafris, which is
                                a term for North African repeated offenders. In practice, the term was used to identify
                                and surveil North Africans in general. For instance, police officers
                                questioned hundreds of North African men in Cologne on 2017’s New Year’s Eve simply
                                because of their race and referred to the men as Nafris in a tweet. The police
                                justified their actions as necessary to combat crime, after hundreds of reports of
                                sexual assaults on New Year’s Eve a year prior. Some criticized the police’s actions as
                                race profiling because the men were targeted due to their national origin. This is
                                clearly an instance of guilt by association, where the men were targeted preemptively
                                for being of North African origin and being out to celebrate New Year’s Eve in Cologne.
