                    <p>In Germany, although there does not seem to be official economic restrictions on Muslims
                        regarding bank accounts, loans, or travel, other obstacles inhibit economic advancement based on
                        faith or appearance. In fact, Turkish muslim immigrants were regarded only as “guest workers”
                        when they first immigrated to Germany. This meant that they were primarily there to fill low
                        paying jobs. However, the mere act of labeling this immigrant population and historically
                        regarding them as temporary “guests” implies that Germany believes they did not have a permanent
                        purpose other than filling jobs. They “were defined primarily in terms of their economic
                        function." This likely fuels Germany’s discrimination and oppression of
                        Muslims today, they are immigrants or if their family has been living there for generations.
                        Ultimately, this discrimination bleeds into all sectors of the lives of German Muslims including
                        financial, housing, and career.
                    </p>
                    <p>With respect to establishing a career, and therefore, a secure financial situation, the Muslim
                        population must face the idea that their Muslim name will often give employers a reason to
                        reject them. Also, “Muslim women are not easily employed because …. even if they are not wearing
                        a scarf, they face discrimination because they might come to work one day wearing a scarf.”

                            <p>In Germany, some states ban veils and German politicians demand wider restrictions on
                                veils. On the national level, there is no such restriction in place. On the state-level,
                                eight out of sixteen have some sort of veil restriction. Despite whether a restriction
                                exists or not, Muslim women who wear any form of veil is a target for Islamophobes in
                                Germany. For instance, in January 2014, a Muslim woman wearing a niqab, which is a
                                full-body veil that only shows her eyes, visited her bank in Nuess, Germany. However, an
                                employee stopped her and asserted that face-coverings were not permitted. She even tried
                                to comply by offering to lift up her veil in front of a female bank worker. However,
                                since only male employees were present, she was unable to complete her bank transaction.
                                After this blatantly Islamophobic incident, several conservative politicials applauded
                                the bank branch and encouraged other German banks to adopt the same behavior toward
                                Muslim women wearing veils.
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition, Muslims in Germany have also been excluded when obtaining housing. When
                                Muslim immigrants first arrived, they would often live in deprived, industrial cities
                                and many lost jobs during the economic crisis in the 1970s and 1980s. This affected
                                housing opportunities for Muslims due to limited “financial resources.” However, this is
                                also apparent because of explicit discrimination. For instance, when a young Muslim man
                                applied for an apartment, the landlord asked “Is your wife wearing the headscarf?” and
                                told the applicant to “write a letter [on] whether [he was] integrated here or not.” And
                                he did not get the flat, and that the reason, unfortunately, was very clear. Each of
                                these anecdotes play their part in the unfair reality faced by German
                                Muslims each day.
