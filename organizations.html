                                <h3>JUMA</h3>
                            </header>
                            <p>In Germany, the Muslim youth group JUMA (Young, Muslim, Active) aims to give young
                                Muslims “a voice and makes their social commitment visible to the general public.”
                                Members do so by sharing their perspectives through social discourse with
                                politicians and journalists. The chairman of the board of Juma is Dennis Kirschbaum,
                                a political educator and interfaith activist. He has been
                                involved with JUMA since its initiation in 2010 by Berlin Senate and RAA (Regional
                                Centre for Education, Integration and Democracy) Berlin. Sponsors of JUMA include Robert
                                Bosch Stiftung, BPB (Federal Agency for Civic Education), and RAA Berlin. Each of these
                                sponsors are focused on social activism, therefore, aligning with the activism done by
                                the young members of JUMA. For example, JUMA brings their perspectives through
                                professional public events, interviews, and blogs regarding refugees, interreligious
                                dialogue, and Islamophobia in education. This group also provides opportunities for
                                members to become peer trainers for interreligious dialogue. With this skill, these
                                young members share their understanding that use of any religion for violence is not
                                compatible with their religious identities. JUMA places a large emphasis on unifying
                                young Muslims despite how they live their faith and does not consider itself a religious
                                organization. Perhaps this is why Muslim funding sources are not listed for this
                                organization.

                            </header>
                            <p>The Central Council of Muslims in Germany is an organization that aims to counter
                                Islamophobia. The organization’s goal is to represent the multi-ethnic Muslim community
                                in Germany. It does not seek to replace mosque communities and Islamic associations. It
                                also hopes to engage in dialogue about Muslim affairs with the German government and
                                other organizations. The Central Council of Muslims in Germany is funded by membership
                                fees, fundraising in mosques, and private donations. The organization’s president, Aiman
                                Mazyek has criticized the rightwing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD) of “riding a
                                wave of Islamophobia.” He said the AfD is “the first time since Hitler's Germany that
                                there is a party which discredits and existentially threatens an entire religious
                                community.” In response to growing Islamophobia in Germany, Mazyek called on the
                                government to appoint an Islamophobia commissioner in 2019. The organization has also
                                advocated for more police presence around mosques in
                                order to deter attacks by extremists.

                            <p>The Islamic Community Millî Görüs (ICMG) is an organization that gives comprehensive
                                religious, social, and cultural services in Germany. The organization is solely funded
                                by its members and has close ties to Turkey’s ruling AKP party. The IGMG
                                participates in Open Mosque Day to allow the public to learn more about Islam, with the
                                aim of eliminating biases against Islam held by portions of the public. In Germany, the
                                ICMG has about 30,000 members and 300 mosques and prayer rooms. The organization is also
                                active in fighting against discrimination. It documents discrimination towards Muslims
                                and deals with discrimination cases. ICMG portrays hate crimes in Germany as
                                symbolic of Islamophobia of German society. They are often accused of
                                being a radical and extremist group by the German intelligence agency “for promoting the
                                creation and expansion of Islamist elements in Germany.”
